 It is a Desktop Virtual Assistant devloped using Python as programming language and concepts of AI like NLP were used for implementation.
 # Desktop Virtual Assistant using Python and Basics of AI

This project is a mini exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and basic AI concepts to create a desktop assistant using Python. The assistant is equipped with speech recognition capabilities and is trained to execute various tasks based on user instructions. Tasks include opening a YouTube video, conducting a Google search, providing weather information, opening files or images, and more.

## Features

- NLP Integration: Utilizes NLP concepts for voice recognition and understanding user commands.
- Task Execution: Performs supported tasks as per user instructions.
- Supported Actions: Includes opening YouTube videos, conducting Google searches, retrieving weather information, and opening files or images.
- Python Libraries: Implements relevant Python libraries and packages for implementation.

## Implementation

The project leverages several Python libraries and packages to accomplish its functionality:

- Speech Recognition: Enables voice-based input recognition.
- NLP Libraries: Utilizes NLP libraries for language understanding and command execution.
- Integration with APIs: Connects to APIs (e.g., YouTube, Google, Weather APIs) for retrieving information and performing tasks.
